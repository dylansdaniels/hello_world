# Alpha (7-14 Hz) and Beta (15-29 Hz) Rhythms: The Mu-Complex #

## Getting Started ##

In order to understand the workflow and initial parameter sets provided with this tutorial, we must first briefly describe prior studies that led to the creation of the data you will aim to simulate. This tutorial is based on results from Jones et al. 2009 where, using MEG, we recorded spontaneous (pre-stimulus) alpha (7-14 Hz) and beta (15-20 Hz) rhythms that arise as part of the mu-complex from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) [1]. (Figure 1. See also [2-4].)

**Left:** Spectrogram of spontaneous activity from current dipole source in SI averaged across 100 trials, from an example subject, shows nearly continuous prestimulus alpha and beta oscillations. At time zero, a brief tap was given to the contralateral finger tip and the spontaneous oscillations briefly desynchronized.

**Right:** A closer look at the prestimulus waveform and spectrogram from spontaneous activity during example signal trials, shows that the alpha and beta oscillations occur intermittently and primarily non-overlapping.</span>
