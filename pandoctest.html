<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>In order to understand the workflow and initial parameter sets provided with this tutorial, we must first briefly describe prior studies that led to the creation of the data you will aim to simulate. This tutorial is based on results from Jones et al. 2009 where, using MEG, we recorded spontaneous (pre-stimulus) alpha (7-14 Hz) and beta (15-20 Hz) rhythms that arise as part of the mu-complex from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) [1]. (Figure 1. See also [2-4].)</p>

<p><strong>Left:</strong> Spectrogram of spontaneous activity from current dipole source in SI averaged across 100 trials, from an example subject, shows nearly continuous prestimulus alpha and beta oscillations. At time zero, a brief tap was given to the contralateral finger tip and the spontaneous oscillations briefly desynchronized.</p>
<p><strong>Right:</strong> A closer look at the prestimulus waveform and spectrogram from spontaneous activity during example signal trials, shows that the alpha and beta oscillations occur intermittently and primarily non-overlapping.</span></p>

<p>Our goal was to use our neocortical model to reproduce features of the waveform and spectrogram observed on single unaveraged trials (Figure 2 top panel, right) where the alpha and beta components emerge briefly and intermittently in time. On any individual trial (i.e., 1 second of spontaneous data), the presence of alpha and beta activity is not time locked and representative of so-called “induced” activity. Seemingly continuous bands of activity occur only when averaging the spectrograms across trials (Figure 2 top panel, left), and this is due to the fact that the spectrograms values are strictly positive and the alpha and beta events accumulate without cancellation [4].</p>

<p>Key features of the spontaneous non-average SI alpha/beta complex include, intermittent transient bouts of alpha/beta activity, a waveform that oscillates around 0nAm, PSD with peaks in the alpha and beta bands, primarily non-overlapping alpha and beta events, and a symmetric waveform oscillation. The model was able to reproduce each of these features.</p>

Schematic illustration of exogenous 10 Hz burst drive through proximal and distal projection pathways.  “Population bursts”, consisting of a set number of “burst units” (10, 2-spike bursts shown) drive post-synaptic conductances in the local network with a set frequency (100 ms ISI) and mean delay between proximal and distal.
